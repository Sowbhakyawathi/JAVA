What is SQL
	Structured Query Language is a programming language for storing and processsing information in a relational database.

	we have 4 types languages
		1. DDL	- Data Definition Language
		2. DML 	- Data Manipulation Language
		3. DCL	- Data Control Language
		4. TCL	- Transaction Control Language
	
DDL	- Data Definition Language
	1. Create
	2. Alter
	3. Drop
	4. Truncate

DML - Data Manipulation Language
	1. Select
	2. Insert
	3. Update
	4. Delete

DCL	- Data Control Language
	1. Grant
	2. Revoke

TCL	- Transaction Control Language
	1. Commit
	2. Rollback
	3. savepoint
	
/*DDL	- Data Definition Language*/

create database employeemgmt;

create table emploee (id int, name varchar(100), phone varchar(10), email varchar(100),
address1 varchar(100), address2 varchar(100), city varchar(100), state varchar(100));

alter table emploee modify phone numeric(10);

alter table emploee modify pin numeric(6);

alter table emploee rename column phone to phone_no;

alter table emploee add (country varchar(100), pin int);

alter table emploee add (DOB date);

alter table emploee add (pin int);

alter table emploee drop column pin;

drop table emploee;


/*DML 	- Data Manipulation Language*/
Insert into emploee (id, name, phone_no, email, address1, address2, city, state, country, pin, dept_id) 
values (1, 'Thiru', 9758593823, 'thiru@gmail.com', '17/7', 'dsdfsd', 'Chennai', 'TamilNadu', 'India', '600064', 101); 

Insert into emploee (id, name, phone_no, email, address1, address2, city, state, country, pin, dept_id) 
values (3, 'Raj', 9876512430, 'Raj@gmail.com', '323', 'sdffgdf', 'Tuticorin', 'TamilNadu', 'India', '628008', 102),
 (4, 'Rajan', 9754245903, 'rajan@gmail.com', '12/1A', ';fdlkgdf;gdf', 'Madurai', 'TamilNadu', 'India', '651002', 101);


select * from emploee;

update emploee set dob = '1985-06-01'
where id = 4;

delete from emploee where id=4;

truncate table emploee;

Where clause operators are
--------------------------
=
>
<
>=
<=
<> - Not equal
Between
Like
in

Order By
--------
asc
desc

AND, OR, Not
------------

It will get first record
-------------------------
select top 1 * from emploee - MSSQL Query

Aggregate Functions
-------------------
	An aggregate function is that perform a calculation on a set of value, and returns a single value.

functions are
-------------
MIN()
MAX()
COUNT()
SUM()
AVG()

Aliases 
-------

JOINS
-----
 A join clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
 
types
-----
	Inner Join (join) - Returns records that have matching values in both table. 
	LEFT (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records from left table and matched record from the right table.
	Right (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records from right table and matched record from the left table.
	Full (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
	
	Self Join - is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.
	
	difference between left and right join
	
UNION Operator
--------------
	The union operator is used to combine the resultset two or more select statement
	
	- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
	- The columns must also have similar data types.
	- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order.
	- UNION should return with unique or distinct values

UNION ALL
---------
	The UNION ALL allow duplicate values.


Group BY statement
------------------
The Group By statement groups row that have the same values into summary rows.

Having
------
The Having clause was added  to SQL because the where keyword cannot be used with aggregate function.

Exists
------
	The Exists operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery


Insert into Select 
------------------
	copy all column from one table to another table.
	
Constraint
----------
	The Primary Key constraint uniquely identifies each record in the table
	
	Primary Key must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain null values.
	The table can have only one primary key; this primary key can consist of single or multiple column.

Foreign Key
-----------
	The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links
